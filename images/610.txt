Jane made a model of her house and took photos of bricks and 
furnture she had.

When using the 3D house model she realized her idea to change 
room layout would not work, and made a closet instead.
Also she found that the best shingle colour to go with the 
colour of bricks was one she never would have thought of.

Jane made a clear renovation plan during lunch breaks at work
and finished her renovation quickly, successfully, without headache
and now enjoys her tea in the evenings after work.
